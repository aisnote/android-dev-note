# 2. UI 

When I developed the Lomorage Android App, I wrote down lots of notes and links, here I want to say thank you to those of articles include open source code.


The basic component is called **Views** 
    
    // It is a UI element, also can be group like Layout.

- All UI elements in the app layout are subclasses of the View class and are called views. TextView and Button are examples of views.
  
- View elements can be grouped inside a ViewGroup. A view group acts as a container for the views, or other view groups, within it. LinearLayout is an example of a view group that arranges its views linearly.
